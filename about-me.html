<h2 class="card-title">Personal</h2>
<p class="card-text-description">I am originally from California, and moved to Austin in the early 90's. During that time I played music in a band. In 2010, I moved back to Los Angeles for work and to be close to family, with the idea that I would eventually return back to Austin, the place I consider home. <br>
I returned in May 2019 and have spent my time working on several design projects with former co-workers, doing freelance work and enjoying the BBQ, and the music here in town.<br>
When I am not working I spend free time doing the following:</p>
