        <p><strong>What is the UX mission?</strong><br>
        The UX mission is to provide a better experience for the user.<br>
        It's aim is to attract people to a site they are interested in; once they are there, make their journey from the home page to purchasing the product, as easy and fun as possible.</p>
        
        <p><strong>A key UX design skill...</strong><br>
        UX design is primarily a people-orientated profession, and therefore a key UX design skill is the ability to understand the needs and behaviors of the user of the site, application, or product.<br>
        The UX designer then seeks to align those needs and desires to the business goals of the company. Always seeking to make each action useful, usable, and as fun for the user as possible.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Connecting UX Design &amp; UI Design</strong><br>
        The purpose of UI design, above all else, is to deliver content and make visual sense of a well planned UX design process.<br>
        The UI designer should be asking the question, 'Does my UI visually communicate the path the UX design has laid out?' This analysis can keep us on the path to successful, useable UI Design.</p>
